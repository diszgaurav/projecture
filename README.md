# projecture
Projecture is a project scaffolding(or a minimal bootstrap) generation tool for various projects (see list of supported project types below). Correctly structuring your project (i.e. some defined standard way or a way which is more acceptable to the related community) makes things easy for you, for contributors and for your users.

## List of supported project types:
- python

# Installation

```bash
pip install projecture
```

# Usages

projecture installation creates a projecture_create executable in your path. Create a new project from command line as:

```bash
projecture_create pyproject --author_name "your name" --author_email "your email" --about "project generated from projecture"
```

or from python:

```python
import projecture
projecture.create_project('pyproject', author_name='your name', author_email='your_email', about='project generated from projecture')
```

This will create pyproject dir in your current working dir.
